        <p> Hello! I'm a Financial Economics major at Texas A&M University, deeply passionate about exploring the intricate dynamics of finance and economics.
            My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in econometrics, statistical methods in finance, financial management, and transfer pricing. 
            This comprehensive education has fueled my enthusiasm for economic research, consultancy, and financial analysis. </p>
        <p>Throughout my academic and professional career, I have actively sought opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios.
            My experience as a research assistant spans various domains, including education and panel surveys.
            Additionally, I have served as a research intern on several development economics projects, where I honed my skills in analyzing diverse data sets, including panel, cross-sectional, time series, and pooled data.</p>
        <p>My proficiency in programming languages such as R, Python, Stata, SAS, Julia, and Matlab allows me to tackle complex data analysis tasks with precision and efficiency. 
           One of my proudest achievements is having a paper accepted at the prestigious International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ISLS), where I co-authored a study on constructionist approaches in teaching complex biology concepts.
           In addition to my technical skills, I have had the privilege of liaising with government and corporate stakeholders through various research projects.
           These experiences have not only enhanced my analytical abilities but also strengthened my communication and collaboration skills.</p>
        <p>I am driven by a relentless commitment to excellence and a passion for breaking down complex economic issues.I am particularly interested in transfer pricing, mergers and acquisitions, and anti-trust issues.
            My long-term aspiration is to rise to the position of Vice President at a leading consultancy firm, where I can make meaningful contributions to the field of economic research and consultancy.
            Outside of my professional interests, I am a firm believer in the importance of personal growth and continuous learning.
            I approach every challenge with grit, consistency, and a dedication to hard work.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. 
            I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring opportunities to contribute to the world of finance and economics.</p>
